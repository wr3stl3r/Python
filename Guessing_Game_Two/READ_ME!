Hi all!
https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2015/11/01/25-guessing-game-two.html

Exercise from here ^

In a previous exercise, we’ve written a program that “knows” a number and asks a user to guess it.

This time, we’re going to do exactly the opposite. You, the user, will have in your head a number between 0 and 100.
The program will guess a number, and you, the user, will say whether it is too high, too low, or your number.

Well i went to far with this :)

#1 I make so computer guesses randomly from all numbers and dot't repeat

#2 Then i changed it and added binary search
    a) This is nice cuz, it can find number from 10000000 it less than 30 guesses

#3 Then i made so Computer searches with Brute force method
